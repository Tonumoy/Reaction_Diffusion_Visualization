### Turing Patterns: Reaction-Diffusion Simulation
![Turing Patterns](https://github.com/Tonumoy/Reaction_Diffusion_Visualization/blob/main/reaction_diffusion.gif)

#### Overview
This repository contains a Python simulation of Turing patterns using the Reaction-Diffusion model, specifically the Grey-Scott model. Turing patterns are naturally occurring patterns that can be observed in chemical reactions and biological systems. This simulation offers a visual insight into how these complex patterns evolve over time.

#### Features
- Implementation of the Reaction-Diffusion equation.
- Optimization of the Laplacian function for enhanced processing speed.

#### Getting Started
To run this simulation, you will need Python and the following libraries: numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. Clone this repository and execute the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-directory
jupyter notebook Turing_Patterns_Reaction_Diffusion.ipynb
```

#### How It Works
The notebook begins with an introduction to the Reaction-Diffusion system, followed by a step-by-step implementation using the Grey-Scott model. It concludes with an optimized version of the Laplacian function, crucial for faster computation of diffusion processes.
